Abiarazi
 You’ve perfected the art of imitating other races, to the point where you could probably pass for a member of nearly any humanoid species. Formless Emissary Knowledge : You gain a +1 trait bonus to Disguise checks to pass for any other humanoid race. Disguise also becomes a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 on Disguise checks. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to your Charisma score. Integration : You’ve spent your entire life among other species, learning to adapt to any culture. When making a Culture check to recall knowledge of another species in order to appear as a member of that species, you may roll the check twice and take the better result. Intervention : You’re adept at saving face in complex social situations, even if your allies are less than diplomatic. Once per day, if an ally within 30 feet would fail a Bluff or Diplomacy check, as a reaction you may roll the same check using your bonuses and substitute that result for your ally’s, as if she had rolled the higher result. Formless Master : You’re so convincing that sometimes you convince yourself. Once per day, when you succeed at a Disguise check, regain 1 Resolve Point.
