Con

Colonist Knowledge  
You have amassed a vast knowledge of past colonization efforts, including those that have failed due to ignorance or carelessness. You know that basic knowledge about a new, uncharted world is the most valuable resource any colonist can have. Reduce the DC to identify average creatures using Life Science by 5. Survival is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you insteadgain a +1 bonus to Survival checks. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Constitution at character creation
Providing for Others 
You know that a colony’s survival means that each colonist look out for everyone else in times of hardship or privation. When you  successfully use the Survival skill to endure severe weather or live off the land, increase the number of other creatures you can grant saving throw bonuses or sustenance to by an amount equal to half your level. You can give another creature any benefit that you would gain from a Survival check to endure severe weather or live off the land (such as a bonus to Fortitude saves or sustenance you would gain), but if you do, you don’t gain it for yourself.
Pioneer’s Resilience 
You are more resistant to effects that would overwhelm a less experienced settler. Once per day, you can reroll a Fortitude saving throw to resist the effects of a disease, poison, or severe weather.
An Eye for the Future 
Up to twice per day when you successfully use the Survival skill to predict the weather, you can spend 10 minutes contemplating what the future holds to regain 1 Stamina Point; this doesn’t count as resting to regain Stamina Points. You must spend 1 minute observing the surrounding area and its weather patterns to use this ability, even if you have another ability that allows you to predict the weather in a shorter amount of time
