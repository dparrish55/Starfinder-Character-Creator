Infamous Knowledge 
When attempting an Intimidate a creature who is aware of your infamous background, decrease the DC by 5. Culture also becomes a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Culture checks. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Charisma at character creation.
Dread Lord 
Up to twice per day when you demean a creature until you utterly humiliate them or break their will, an act that takes at least 10 minutes, you recover 1 Resolve Point. A variant theme is a modification to an existing theme. These give an adjustment to a few parts of the theme while keeping the other aspects intact. This is often to give a theme new flavor or an interesting new angle while keeping the rough idea the same.
