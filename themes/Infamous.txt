VariantIconTheme
You are not so much a famous celebrity as an infamous one. Your “fans” are actually those who fear your reputation and will give you things out of fear or respect. While they are the same theme ability, you can refer to the one you get at 6th level as “Infamous” and the one at 12th as “Dreaded”.
Infamous Knowledge 
When attempting an Intimidate a creature who is aware of your infamous background, decrease the DC by 5. Culture also becomes a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Culture checks. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Charisma at character creation.
Dread Lord 
Up to twice per day when you demean a creature until you utterly humiliate them or break their will, an act that takes at least 10 minutes, you recover 1 Resolve Point. A variant theme is a modification to an existing theme. These give an adjustment to a few parts of the theme while keeping the other aspects intact. This is often to give a theme new flavor or an interesting new angle while keeping the rough idea the same.
