Manu
 Prerequisite Manu You’ve spent years helping to create and repair engineered items. Shipbuilder Knowledge : When you successfully use the aid another action to aid an ally’s Engineering check, that character gains a +2 circumstance bonus to the check (in addition to the +2 bonus normally granted for successfully aiding another). Engineering also becomes a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 on Engineering checks. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to your Intelligence score. Builder Prodigy : After years of working on spacefaring vessels, learning the ins and outs of their design and construction, you have become a master builder. You gain a +4 bonus to Engineering checks to craft or repair parts of spacefaring vessels, and you never damage such items you attempt to repair, no matter how much you fail the check by. Jury-Rig : You’ve become adept at using cheaper materials without reducing the stability or reliability of the vessels you create. You may add your character level to the build points of a vessel you build without increasing its cost. If you are part of an adventuring crew, this build point increase applies to your crew’s starship as long as you travel with the crew. Master Shipbuilder : Fixing things is cathartic for you, and can even recharge you. Once per day, when you successfully repair a technological item with the Engineering skill, you regain 1 Resolve Point.
